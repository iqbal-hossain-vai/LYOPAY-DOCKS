A coin being listed on different exchanges is one of the most significant achievements of a crypto project. Aside from making the coin available in the market, it also allows the coinâ€™s value to be determined.

### Requirements&#x20;

* The management team of the coin issuer
* Platform where the coin is already used and its technological background
* Token utility
* White paper
* Coin legal opinion and targeted jurisdictions of the coin offering
* Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism legislation compliance

### Why list your token on LYOTRADE?&#x20;

#### **Increase your community's ability to trade, buy, and sell tokens**

Listing makes your token available to buy. People from the project's community will be able to freely buy and sell the token, thereby creating market volume.

#### **Market expansion**&#x20;

Every exchange has its own community that is usually made up according to its users' principles and their geographical location. Some exchanges operate worldwide and have traders from around the world, but there are also exchanges that are more focused on local markets (e.g., Korea, Latin America, and Eastern Europe). Being listed on a new exchange means entering new markets and introducing your coin or token to a new set of users. Listing on a new exchange is not only an opportunity to boost trade volume and liquidity, but also for the project to attract the attention of crypto users and turn them into community members, establishing a presence in a particular region.&#x20;

#### **Partnerships in new markets**&#x20;

A new listing is an entry into a new market. Along with the listing, other integrations into these markets are also possible. For example, you can establish partnerships with other players in your industry from these regions that will only enhance the effect of your listing. Getting listed makes it easier to find and negotiate partnerships.
