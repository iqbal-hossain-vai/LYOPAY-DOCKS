4.2.7. Staking Pools

4.2.7.1. Staking is a process in which individuals hold virtual assets in a specialized wallet for twelve (12) or twenty-four (24) months. By choosing to stake with LYOTRADE, you are confirming that you have read, comprehended, and accepted all the terms and conditions associated with the Staking Pools. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that you will adhere to these terms and be bound by them. You shall note that if you do not understand these terms, it is advisable not to participate in staking with LYOTRADE.

4.2.7.2. Staking is available on our Platform for two tokens, such as LYOCREDIT and USDT. You can access the Staking page by visiting the following link: [https://www.lyotrade.com/en\_US/freeStaking](https://www.lyotrade.com/en\_US/freeStaking)&#x20;

4.2.7.3. You acknowledge and agree that the estimated Annual Percentage Yield (APY) provided is subject to daily adjustments based on the on-chain staking rewards. This means that the APY may vary depending on the rewards distributed by the blockchain network. During the staking period, it is crucial to understand that your Virtual Assets will be locked on-chain. As a result, you will not have the ability to withdraw or perform any transactions involving the allocated assets until the staking period concludes. This lock-up period ensures the integrity and security of the staking process. Therefore, before participating in staking, we recommend carefully considering the duration of the lock-up period and understanding the implications of not being able to access or utilize the staked assets during that time.

4.2.7.4. You acknowledge and agree that unlocking your staked assets requires a specific amount of time, which is determined by the specifications of the underlying blockchain network you are staking on. The exact duration of the lock-up period will depend on the specific chain and staking rules in place. You further agree that the redemption or release of your LYOTRADE locked staking amount will only occur after the designated time period for staking has elapsed. It is your responsibility to  consider this time frame when planning your staking activities.&#x20;

4.2.7.5. Upon the expiration of the subscribed locked staking product, your assets will be redeemed from the blockchain. However, please be aware that the redemption process requires a specific unlocking period. The redemption process may take one day to unlock the tokens and an additional day to redeem the assets. You agree and acknowledge that the actual time required for redemption may vary due to factors such as blockchain network conditions and time zone differences. As a result, it's possible that the entire process, including unlocking and fund redemption, may take up to thirty (30) days in total.

4.2.7.6. The withdrawal of the principal amount is only possible on the day of the principal release date. The User’s interests will be automatically deposited to the Spot Wallet, and you may withdraw the interest received at any time during the staking period.&#x20;

4.2.7.7. Please note that the amount staked in the Staking Pool is subject to the volatile nature of the Virtual Asset. This means that the principal amount you have staked may fluctuate due to the inherent volatility of the Virtual Asset. Additionally, the interest accumulated on a daily basis is also subject to the volatile nature of the Virtual Asset you have staked. The interest earned can vary based on market conditions and the performance of the Virtual Asset you have staked.

4.2.7.8. By participating in the Staking Pool, you agree and acknowledge that there are inherent risks associated with the volatile nature of the Virtual Asset. These risks may result in potential fluctuations in the principal amount staked and the interest earned. In the unfortunate event of the User's death, as stipulated in clause 9, the interest accumulated up to that point will be withdrawn according to the terms and conditions outlined in that clause.&#x20;

4.2.7.9. You agree and acknowledge the risks associated with the volatile nature of the Virtual Asset before participating in the Staking Pool. Carefully reviewing and comprehending the specific terms and conditions, including clause 9, will provide further clarity on the procedures and actions taken in the event of the User's death.

To stay updated with the latest information, you can visit our official channels at [https://linktr.ee/lyopay](https://linktr.ee/lyopay).&#x20;

You shall be cautious and vigilant regarding potential scams. Beware of entities or individuals using airdrops and free tokens as a means to deceive people on social media platforms like Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram. Scammers may operate under names such as LYO Ecosystem and LYO Credit. These scams typically entice Users to send Virtual Assets transactions to specific wallets by promising profits or requesting Users to click on risky links. Always exercise caution and verify the authenticity of any page or account you encounter. Ensure that you are interacting with the original and legitimate sources associated with LYOTRADE.

You acknowledge and accept that LYOTRADE will never ask you to send transactions to Virtual Assets wallets or share sensitive information. If you come across any suspicious profiles or encounter potential scams, please report them immediately to protect yourself and other users from fraudulent activities.
