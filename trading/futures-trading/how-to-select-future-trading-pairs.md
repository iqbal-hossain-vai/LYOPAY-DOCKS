## **How to select future trading pairs?**

Go to the Futures trading interface and click on the futures contract symbol to open the search box.

1. There are 2 types of futures contracts: USDⓈ-Margined Futures and Coin-Margined Futures. Select your preferred futures contract. For example, if you want to trade BTCUSDT perpetual contracts, click \[USDⓈ-M].
2. Select the contract symbol you want to trade. You may rank all listed symbols based on volume or 24-hour price change.
3. Alternatively, you can search for a specific crypto futures contract using the search bar. For instance, if you search for “XRP”, all XRP contracts (Quarterly or Perpetual) will be displayed in the dropdown menu.
