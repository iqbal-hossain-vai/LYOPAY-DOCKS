## Futures Trading

Cryptocurrency futures trading is a contract between two traders or investors that bet on the **future price** of a cryptocurrency. Futures contracts are derivatives of an underlying asset, which are bought and sold between two investors. Then, they will speculate about the price trajectory of that asset at a specific date in the future.&#x20;

The contracts indicate certain requirements that investors must meet such as a specific number of units, pricing, marginal requirements, and settlement methods.
