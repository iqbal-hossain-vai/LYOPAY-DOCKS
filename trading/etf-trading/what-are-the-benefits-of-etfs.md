Holding a variety of investments can help diversify the risk of a portfolio. Buying just one ETF can give you a stake in hundreds of stocks or bonds. An international ETF, for example, could broaden your portfolio with stock holdings from around the world, while a bond ETF might span much of the investment-grade market.
