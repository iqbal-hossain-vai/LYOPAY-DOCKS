## What are the fees?

The transaction fee rate of ETF products is the same as that of spot transactions (mostly 0.1%).&#x20;

A daily management fee is charged at 00:00 (UTC+8), which will be reflected in the net value of ETF products. There is no charge if one does not hold any ETF product shares.
