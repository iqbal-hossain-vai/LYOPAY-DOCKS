## What is the difference between ETFs and stocks?&#x20;

A share is a small fraction of a company that can be bought or sold after the shares are listed on a stock exchange through an initial public offering (IPO). When you buy a share, you own a part of a company, which means you can receive a percentage of the dividend (if it is distributed) and that you can also get the right to vote.

ETFs are traded in a similar way to shares, but unlike individual stocks, they track the performance of the underlying asset or a basket of assets. They can track the performance of a selection of markets, including corporate stocks, indices and commodities, but the investor does not own the underlying assets.
