# Spot Account

## Spot Account

Spot trading involves considering the time value of the share price, which is influenced by maturity and interest rates. In spot foreign exchange transactions, the rate at which changes happen is known as the spot exchange rate. Comparing it to futures or forward trading can provide valuable insights. Users can access their spot trading account balance by navigating to the "Balances" section on the home page. From there, they can check their spot account balance.
