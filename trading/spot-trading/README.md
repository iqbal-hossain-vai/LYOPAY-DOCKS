## Spot Trading

The spot market is where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, LYO Credit, and other altcoins are traded, bought, and exchanged **instantaneously for immediate delivery**. It is also where traders hold their crypto assets until their value increases. Here, transactions are done on the spot, hence the name spot trading.&#x20;

Traders in a spot market can easily exchange their cryptocurrency for another crypto or fiat currency by placing a buy or sell order. Their goal is to make a profit by buying low and selling high. However, due to the crypto market's volatility, it is not guaranteed that earning through spot trading works all the time.&#x20;

Also included in the spot market are:&#x20;

* **Sellers**: the ones who create an order with a specific sell price.&#x20;
* **Buyers**: the ones who place an order with a bid or purchase price.&#x20;
* **Order book**: it is where the bids and asks of a trader are recorded.&#x20;

1. **Bid price**: the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay.&#x20;
2. **Ask price**: the lowest price of a payment that a seller is willing to accept.&#x20;

There are three concepts of spot trading that traders should keep in mind:&#x20;

* **Spot price**: the current price of an asset&#x20;
* **Trade date**: the day when the market will perform the trade.&#x20;
* **Settlement date**: also known as spot date, this is the time when the traded assets will be transferred to the involved accounts. &#x20;
