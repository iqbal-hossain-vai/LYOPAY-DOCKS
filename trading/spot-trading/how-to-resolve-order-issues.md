## **How to resolve order issues?**&#x20;

There are some problems that you may encounter when trading on LYOTRADE. We can divide these into two categories:&#x20;

1\. **Your trade order is not executing:**

* Check the selected order’s price in the open orders section. Verify whether or not it has matched a counterparty’s order (bid/ask) with this price level and volume.
* If you would like to expedite your order, consider canceling it from the open orders section and submitting a new order at a more competitive price. For a quick settlement, you may also consider using a market order.

2\. **Your order has a technical issue:**

Issues like the inability to cancel your orders or coins not being credited to your account require further support. Please contact our customer support team and provide screenshots that will document:

* The order’s details
* Any error code or exception message.
