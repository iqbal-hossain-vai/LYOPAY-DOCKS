2\. Fill in the details of your stop price (trigger price), the limit price for the triggered limit order, and the amount of crypto you wish to purchase. Click **\[Buy LYO]** to confirm the details of the transaction.

In our example, the stop price is 500 LYO and the limit price is 502 LYO.

3\. Double-check your stop-limit order carefully before finally clicking confirm to submit it to the exchange.

Once your orders have been submitted, existing ‘stop-limit’ orders can be found and reviewed in **\[Open Orders]**. When orders are executed or discarded, your stop-limit order history can be found under **\[Order History]**.
