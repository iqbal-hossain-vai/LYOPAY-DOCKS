The default order type is a limit order. If traders want to place an order as soon as possible, they may switch to **\[Market]** Order to trade instantly at the current market price.

If the market price of LYO/USDT is at 0.002, but you want to buy at a specific price, for example, 0.001, you can place a **\[Limit]** order. When the market price reaches your set price, your placed order will be executed.

The percentages shown below the **\[Amount]** field refer to the percentage amount of USDT you wish to trade for LYO. Pull the slider across to change the desired amount.
