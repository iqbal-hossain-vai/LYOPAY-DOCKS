## What are orders and how to create it?

When placing a market order, the investor or trader is assured of paying the specified price or less. However, it's important to note that while the price is guaranteed, the execution of the order is not. The order will only be executed if the cryptocurrency price meets the necessary qualifications.

To place a market order, follow these steps:

1. Open the LYOTRADE web browser or mobile app.
2. Select a market pair, which can be a crypto/crypto or crypto/fiat trading pair.
3. Choose the Buy or Sell tab and click on the Market button.
4. Input the desired size of your order or use the slider to specify the order size.
5. Confirm the order.

By following these steps, you can successfully place a market order.
