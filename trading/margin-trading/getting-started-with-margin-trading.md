## Getting started with margin trading

Margin trading on LYOTRADE is easy. Once you are done creating an account, complete your KYC identification process and enable 2FA for an added layer of security.&#x20;

Under your account balance information, youâ€™ll find exchange and margin details; click on **\[Margin]**.

1. After carefully reading the margin account agreement, select **\[I understand]**.
2.  Then, you will be able to transfer funds into your new Margin Trading Wallet. For example, you can transfer BTC, ETH, and BNB from the Exchange Wallet to the Margin Wallet. These funds will act as collateral to any borrowed funds incorporated in a margin trade and determine how much you can borrow.\

3. Click **\[Borrow/Repay]**, enter the amount you wish to borrow, note the hourly interest rate, and click **\[Confirm Borrow]**. The funds will be credited to your margin account (which can be checked under your balance/margin button). The balance dash comes with a margin level gauge that relates the risk level to the borrowed funds, the collateral you hold, and the market value. Margin level can be calculated as such: Margin Level = Total Asset Value / (Total Borrowed + Total Accrued Interest)
4. If your margin level decreases, you either need to increase your collateral or reduce your loan. A margin level of 1.1 will automatically be liquidated, which means LYOTRADE will sell the funds at market price to repay the loan.
