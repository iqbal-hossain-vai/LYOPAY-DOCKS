## OTC Trading &#x20;

An **over-the-counter (OTC)** market is a decentralized market in which market participants trade crypto, stocks, commodities, and currencies directly between two parties and without a central exchange or broker.&#x20;

Over-the-counter markets do not have physical locations; instead, trading is conducted electronically.&#x20;

In an OTC market, dealers act as market-makers by quoting prices at which they will buy and sell products. A trade can be executed between two participants in an OTC market without others being aware of the price at which the transaction was completed.﻿﻿&#x20;

In general, OTC markets are typically less transparent than exchanges and are also subject to fewer regulations. Because of this, liquidity in the OTC market may come at a premium.
