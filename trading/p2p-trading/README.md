## P2P Trading

### **What is peer-to-peer (P2P) trading?**  <a href="#_9swygq1z3y8n" id="_9swygq1z3y8n"></a>

Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is the process of buying and selling cryptocurrencies directly between users without the help of any intermediaries.&#x20;

Traditional exchanges do not allow users to transact directly with another user. In this type of setting, traders use tools that will help determine the best time to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies. The transaction is organized by the exchange on behalf of the user and the market price will determine the final price during the transaction.&#x20;

In P2P trading, the user is given complete control over who buys their crypto, who will they buy from, the pricing, and the time of settlement. Since peer-to-peer transactions are free from any third party, users may encounter some risks during these deals. Choosing a reliable exchange like LYOTRADE P2P will help users minimize such dangers.\
