## Savings

LYOTRADE's Savings feature offers users the ability to earn interest on their **BTC**, **ETH**, and **USDT** holdings **without a lock-in period**.&#x20;

Similar to staking, users can earn rewards on their savings while being able to withdraw their crypto anytime. Additionally, you can view the rewards on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis before subscribing, using the **\[Interest Calculator]** feature.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The annual return on savings is subject to change and may fluctuate based on market conditions surrounding the tokens.
{% endhint %}

To **access the Savings feature**, hover over the **\[Services]** option on the top-left side of the main menu and click **\[Savings]**. From there, you can calculate future interest and subscribe by entering the required details.&#x20;

To **view your current savings** balance and returns, click the **\[Balances]** option after logging in to your LYOTRADE account, and select the **\[Savings Account]** option. Here, you can view returns earned from your savings and redeem them from your subscription. You can also view returns from your entire portfolio or token-wise.
