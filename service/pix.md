## PIX

LYOTRADE's PIX on-ramp allows Brazilian users to easily purchase cryptocurrency with their fiat currency. PIX is a real-time payment technology from the Central Bank of Brazil, which enables users to authenticate payments from their mobile payment application without sharing sensitive card details. Brazilian bank account holders can make payments in BRL without the need for credit/debit card or bank account details, using only their CPF for identification and verification.&#x20;
