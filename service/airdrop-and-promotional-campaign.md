## Airdrop & Promotional Campaign

An airdrop is a marketing strategy used to promote a new virtual currency. It involves sending small amounts of the new currency to the wallets of a platform's active members for free or in return for a small task, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

Occasionally, we run airdrops and promotional campaigns for users and new users to get **free tokens**, such as LYO Credit. Please keep yourself updated by checking our official pages, which you can find here: [https://linktr.ee/lyopay](https://linktr.ee/lyopay)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Beware of scam entities using airdrops and free tokens to deceive people on social media, such as Telegram channels, Facebook, and Instagram accounts operating under the names LYOPAY and LYO Credit. These scams may invite you to send cryptocurrency transactions to wallets, promising a profit in exchange or clicking on dangerous links.

* Always check that the page or account is the original one.
* Please note that LYOPAY will never ask you to send transactions to cryptocurrency wallets or share information.&#x20;
* If you encounter any such scams, please report the profiles immediately.
