## Identity verification for buying crypto with a card

To ensure a stable and compliant fiat gateway, users buying crypto with credit & debit cards are required to complete an identity verification process. Users who have already completed Identity Verification for the LYOTRADE account will be able to continue to buy crypto without any additional information required.

Users who are required to provide extra information will be prompted the next time they attempt to make a crypto purchase with a credit or debit card.

Each Identity Verification level completed will grant increased transaction limits as listed below. All transaction limits are fixed to BTC regardless of the fiat currency used and thus will vary slightly in other fiat currencies according to exchange rates.

This verification requires the userâ€™s name, address, and date of birth, and identity & face verification.&#x20;

* Transaction limit: up to 50 BTC/weekly

This verification level will require a copy of a valid photo ID and taking a selfie to prove identity. Face verification will require a smartphone or a PC/Mac with a webcam.

* Transaction limit: up to 200 BTC/weekly

To increase your limit, you will need to complete your Identity Verification and Address Verification (proof of residency, including country, city, street), bank statement or utility bill, or tenancy contract.

* If you want to increase your daily limit to be higher than 500 BTC/weekly, you will need to add a short video.
