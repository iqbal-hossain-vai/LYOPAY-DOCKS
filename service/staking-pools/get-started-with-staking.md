## Get started with staking

On the Staking [page](https://www.lyotrade.com/en\_US/freeStaking), you can see all the Locked Staking products with the estimated percentage yield, duration days, and minimum locked amount.

1\. Choose the asset you want to stake and the lock period, then click **\[Details].** You will find more information about the selected staking offer:

You can click on each of the different options and insert the amount you want to stake to see their respective estimated earnings to pick the best offer.

Please note that the estimated APY is adjusted daily based on the on-chain staking rewards. During the staking period, your assets will be locked on-chain, so you won't be able to withdraw or perform any transactions with the allocated assets.

The available amount shows the available balance in your Spot Wallet that you can use to stake on Locked Staking. There is a minimum amount required for staking. If your balance is lower than that, you won't be able to stake it.

Once you subscribe to the product, interest will be calculated from 00:00 (UTC) of the following day, and are distributed to your Fiat and Spot Wallet weekly after 00:00 (UTC). When the process is complete, the staked assets will be redeemed automatically and returned to your Spot Wallet.

After confirming the details, enter the locked amount you want to stake and click **\[Agree to PoS]**.

2\. In this section, you can check the **\[Pending]**, **\[Processing],** and **\[Finished]** staking operations.

3\. To view your Locked Staking history, go to **\[Staking]- \[Staking Report]** or you can check by clicking on **\[Balances]**-**\[Financial Account]**.

Please note that unlocking your staked assets requires a specific time based on the specifications of the chain you're staking on. LYOTRADE Locked Staking amount will only be redeemed or released after the specific time chosen for staking. However, it sometimes takes up to 48-72 hours to receive the tokens due to different global time zones.
