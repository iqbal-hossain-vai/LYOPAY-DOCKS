## Why does it take several days for my funds to arrive after I redeem from locked staking?

As staking is conducted on the blockchain via smart contracts, the token redemption time varies according to the blockchain's consensus mechanism. Different blockchains require different redemption times. For example, to unstake EOS, you need to wait 72 hours, while unstaking DOT requires you to wait 28 days.

LYOTRADE optimized the funds' distribution process and shortened the redemption time from 30 days to 1 day. Please note that the standard redemption time is subjected to the actual redemption time of the blockchain, LYOTRADE may adjust the 1-day redemption time in the future.
