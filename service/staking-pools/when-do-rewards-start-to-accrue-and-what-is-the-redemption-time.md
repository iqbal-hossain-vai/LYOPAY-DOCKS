## When do rewards start to accrue and what is the redemption time?

When you subscribe to a Locked Staking product, the amount required for the subscription will be deducted from your Spot Account.

The interest will not incur on the day of the subscription. The interest will start to incur from the interest start date and will be distributed weekly. For example, if you subscribe on 1 Feb, interest will be calculated from the interest start date which will be 1 Mar onwards and will be distributed on weekly basis.

Redemption after the product expires when the subscribed product expires, your assets will be redeemed from the chain and it requires a certain unlocking period. It takes one day to unlock the tokens and one day to redeem the funds. Due to time zone differences, it may take up to 48-72 hours in total.

The withdrawal of the principal amount is only possible on the day of the principal release date, however, the user can withdraw the interest received at any time.
