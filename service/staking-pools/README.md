## Staking Pools

Crypto staking is the act of **holding cryptocurrency in a special wallet** **for a certain period of time**, which helps to support the operations of a blockchain network. In exchange for staking, users receive rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.

**Staking pools** are groups of users who combine their cryptocurrency holdings to increase their chances of being chosen to validate transactions and earn rewards. By pooling resources, users can increase their chances of earning rewards, even if they have a smaller amount of cryptocurrency to stake.
