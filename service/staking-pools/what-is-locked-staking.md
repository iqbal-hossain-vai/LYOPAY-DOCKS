## What is locked staking?&#x20;

Locked staking refers to the process of locking your digital assets on a Proof of Stake blockchain for a certain period of time. This not only contributes to the network but also provides you with staking rewards.

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism that selects block validators based on the number of coins they stake. The more coins you stake, the higher the rewards.

In a way, you could think of holding your coins on LYOTRADE as adding them to a staking pool. However, there are no fees, and you can also enjoy all the other benefits that holding your coins on LYOTRADE brings.

The only thing you have to do is hold your PoS coins on LYOTRADE, and all the technical requirements will be taken care of for you. The staking rewards are usually distributed weekly from the day of the interest start date.

You can check the previously distributed rewards for a given coin under the Historical Yield tab on each projectâ€™s staking page.

LYOTRADE Locked Staking provides an easy way for holders to stake and earn rewards.
