## What happens if the market goes up and the collateral is worth more?

When you repay the loan, we will return you the same amount of cryptocurrency as deposited. If your collateral size is 1 BTC, you will get back 1 BTC irrespective of its current market price. This is the fundamental value we provide: you can get some money now as a loan while your main long-term investment in crypto stays with you and keeps bringing you profits.
