## When is the loan received?

The average period of giving loans and releasing collaterals is 5-10 minutes, depending on how fast we receive your deposit.

Moreover, the current state of the network and the network fee size can influence the period of us receiving collaterals. Make sure to set an appropriate network fee so that the transaction is confirmed as fast as possible.
