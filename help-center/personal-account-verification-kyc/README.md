## Personal Account Verification

### Know Your Customer (KYC)&#x20;

Know Your Customer is a process of a financial entity verifying the identity of customers and evaluating their authenticity, along with the prospects of unlawful purposes and practices. Money laundering is one of the significant menaces in a country’s economy. Financial institutions and the government are always on the watch for such illegal activities. Mandating KYC formalities for banking or investment transactions is an effective way to prevent this. LYOTRADE's KYC system implements automated KYC/AML services from Sumsub, a leading provider of KYC/AML blockchain solutions. You can do KYC online while opening an account by following these steps:

* Registration
* Profile Details
* Other Information
* Documents Upload

In order to start buying and selling cryptocurrencies, the first step is verifying your account:

* **Register your account:** using your email address or phone number. Now you will need to enter some additional information to complete Basic Verification and proceed with the sign-up process. A code will be sent to you through email or SMS in order to activate the account.
