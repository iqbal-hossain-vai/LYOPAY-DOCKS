## What is Two-factor Authentication (2FA)?

Two-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes referred to as two-step verification or dual-factor authentication, is a security process in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. It is a two-part process that usually involves the following:&#x20;

* Your password
* A code sent to one of your devices&#x20;
* Fingerprint scan&#x20;
* Facial recognition&#x20;
* Retina scan

2FA is implemented to better protect your credentials and the resources that you can access. Two-factor authentication provides a higher level of security than authentication methods that depend on single-factor authentication (SFA), in which the user provides only one factor typically, a password.
