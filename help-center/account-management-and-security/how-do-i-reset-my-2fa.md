## How do I reset my 2FA?

If you can't access both your registered email and two-factor authentication (2FA), you need to contact LYOTRADE customer service first to submit a request.&#x20;

The team will ask you three security questions that will help verify your identity (Date of Birth / Date of Account creation / Wallet Balance). Then, our Customer Service will ask you to submit a video to verify your request.

### **What should be included in the video?**&#x20;

* You need to sit in front of the camera and show your face clearly and hold your ID document in one hand and a hand-written paper with the necessary information of your request in your other hand.&#x20;
* You need to make a statement into the camera to verify your identity, such as: "Current Date, Date of Birth, Place of Birth, Registered Email Address, Account Opening Date and Approx Balance Amount in your Wallet in order to apply to unlock your account. You need to mention that you hereby confirm that you are contacting LYOTRADE Customer Support to reset your 2FA for your LYOTRADE Account**.**
* Submit the video along with the device-clicked picture of your National ID Card/Driving License/Valid Passport shown in the video and the hand-written paper. Please do not use any filters or edit your videos.&#x20;
