## How do I delete my account?

You can request for your LYOTRADE account to be deleted. It's not possible to do it yourself.

Before closing your account, you must withdraw all funds from all of your wallets. We can't delete your account if there are funds in any of your wallets.

1. Go to **\[Account]** - **\[Security]**.
2. Click on Submit request for account deletion.
3. Fill out the form and submit it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The security and compliance team will then review your request and delete your account.
{% endhint %}

If your request is accepted:

* All trading capacities and login for your account will be disabled.&#x20;
* All API keys, as well as devices for your account, will be deleted.&#x20;
* All pending withdrawals and open orders will be canceled.

If you have questions about your LYOTRADE account even after it's closed, please contact the support team at [support@lyotrade.com](mailto:support@lyotrade.com).&#x20;
