## Why can't I verify my phone number?

If you are not able to verify your mobile number, make sure that:&#x20;

1. The mobile number you entered is correct.&#x20;
2. The mobile number has no special characters, no spaces, and has the country code.&#x20;
3. The phone number is not used in another LYOTRADE account. Otherwise, you need to enter a different phone number.&#x20;
4. The phone number can receive SMSs. On the verification code screen, you can ask for the code to be sent again.
