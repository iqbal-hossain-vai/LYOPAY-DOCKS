## How to change password?

To change the password, the user needs to be logged in first. Once logged in, they should navigate to the top right corner of the page. In the top right corner, there is a symbol (usually representing a person) that users can click on. Upon clicking, multiple options will appear, with the first option being "Change Password." When users select this option, they will be prompted to provide the initial password, new password, confirm password, and phone verification code. Once all the required information is provided correctly, the user's password will be changed successfully.
