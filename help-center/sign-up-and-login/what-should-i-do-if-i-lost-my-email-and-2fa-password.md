## What should I do if I lost my email and 2FA password?

If you don’t have access to your original email and to your account’s Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), you need to contact LYOTRADE customer service to submit your request.&#x20;

The team will reply back with three security questions to verify your identity:&#x20;

1. Date of Birth
2. Date of Account creation
3. Wallet Balance&#x20;

Then, our Customer Service will ask you to submit a video to verify your request.

* You need to sit in front of the camera and show your face clearly while holding your ID document in one hand and a hand-written paper with the necessary information of your request in your other hand.
* Users need to make a statement into the camera to verify their identity, such as:&#x20;
  * Current Date&#x20;
  * Date of Birth&#x20;
  * Place of Birth&#x20;
  * Registered Email Address
  * Account Opening Date&#x20;
  * Approx Balance Amount in your Wallet
* The user needs to mention that they are confirming that they are contacting the LYOTRADE Customer Support to reset their 2FA and LYOTRADE account.&#x20;
* Submit the video along with the picture of your National ID Card/Driving License/Valid Passport shown in the video and the hand-written paper. Please do not use any filters or edit your videos.
