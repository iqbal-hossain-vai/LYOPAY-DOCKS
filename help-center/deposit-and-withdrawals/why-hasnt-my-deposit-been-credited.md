## Why hasn’t my deposit been credited?

Transferring funds from an external platform to LYOTRADE involves these steps:

1. Withdrawal from the external platform.
2. Blockchain network confirmation.
3. LYOTRADE credits the funds to your account.
4. An asset withdrawal marked as “completed” or “success” in the platform you're withdrawing your crypto from means that the transaction was successfully broadcast to the blockchain network.

However, it might still take some time for that particular transaction to be fully confirmed and credited to the platform you’re withdrawing your crypto to. The amount of required “network confirmations” varies for different blockchains.

Due to possible network congestion, there might be a significant delay in processing your transaction. You may use the [TxID](transaction-id-txid.md) (Transaction ID) to look up the status of the transfer of your assets by using a blockchain explorer.

* If the transaction has not yet been fully confirmed by the blockchain network nodes or has not reached the minimum amount of network confirmations specified by our system, please wait patiently for it to be processed. When the transaction has been confirmed, LYOTRADE will credit the funds to your account.
* If the transaction is confirmed by the blockchain but not credited to your LYOTRADE account, you may contact our Customer Support team: [support@lyotrade.com](mailto:support@lyotrade.com)
